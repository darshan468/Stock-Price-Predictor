# Stock-Price-Predictor
Stock-Price-Predictor is a machine learning-based project that forecasts future stock prices using historical market data. It leverages regression techniques to model stock trends and provides visual insights for better analysis. The tool is built using Python and supports model training, evaluation, and prediction in an easy-to-use interface. Ideal for learning financial forecasting and time-series prediction.

# load dataset
The dataset is loaded using the yfinance library, which allows seamless access to historical stock market data directly from Yahoo Finance. It includes key financial indicators such as Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume ‚Äî essential features for predicting stock price trends.

# Build Model
The model is built using Linear Regression, which learns from historical stock data to predict future prices. Key features like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume are used as inputs. The data is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and then fed into the model to identify patterns and trends.

üìà This simple yet powerful model helps demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to real-world financial forecasting.

# Compile Model
Once the model architecture is defined, it's compiled using appropriate loss functions and optimizers. For regression tasks like stock price prediction, we use Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function and Adam or SGD as the optimizer. This step prepares the model for efficient learning from the training data.

# Train Model
The model is trained on historical stock data by feeding in features such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. The training process involves adjusting model weights to minimize prediction error using techniques like Linear Regression or advanced models like LSTM. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to validate model performance.

‚è≥ As the model trains, it learns the hidden patterns behind market movements ‚Äî turning past data into future insights.

# Conclusion
The Stock-Price-Predictor demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world financial data for predictive analysis. By leveraging historical stock prices, the model offers valuable insights into potential market trends. Whether you're a beginner exploring finance and AI or an analyst prototyping trading strategies, this project provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and deeper forecasting techniques.

üìä Predict the market. Learn from the past. Build for the future.
